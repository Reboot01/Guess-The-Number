> A console-based guess the number game, written in C#

# Install

Just make sure you have a recent version of the .NET Framework installed. If you're running a recent version of Windows, this should already be the case.

# Usage

Just run the executable. You'll be greeted with a basic prompt. The game's number generator will only be from 1-100, typing in anything but numbers will give you an error message.
